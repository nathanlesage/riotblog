# Riots as _Stasis_

> To riot is to fail the measure of the human. To fail to be the subject. (Joshua Clover, _Riot. Strike. Riot._, p. 166)

Reading riots through the perspective of _stasis_ as “restless repose,” it is possible to link dispersed accounts of riots littered throughout sociology, psychology, and political science. Thereby it is possible to compile a single conception of the “how,” “why,” and “by whom” of such violent outbursts of protests and focus on their political essence. Following a theoretical development, a study of contemporary protest movements from the Tottenham riots through the “Arab Spring” to the riots in France and Hongkong can produce insights into a field still in academic twilight. The objectives of this project are to merge the theoretical splinters of _stasis_ into a coherent concept and use it to develop a political theory of riots. Especially, this project aims at detecting differences and similarities of riots across different political and economic cultures and highlight the interdependence of global economic processes on a structural level with local societies and political initiatives.
