# About the Project

“What is a riot?” This is the central question this project aims to answer. If you think about it, could you name specifics of what something must possess in order to call it a riot? Certainly, there needs to be violence. But what kind of violence? Blind rage? Ordered and targeted one? And against what? How many people are necessary before it can be called a riot?

This ambiguity is what the project _Riots as Stasis_ is about. It aims to clarify our understanding of riot, providing categories and theoretical underpinnings so that we can afterwards begin a more structured analysis of the phenomenon of riot.

## About me

I’m currently a research assistant at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg ([IFSH](https://www.ifsh.de)). While my PhD project is all about riots, my work focus is military software, artificial intelligence, and what we can expect from military weapon systems in the next years. [Have a look](https://ifsh.de/en/research/research-area-3/algorithmen-und-kuenstliche-intelligenz-als-game-changer), if you’re interested! Last but not least, I develop an academic Markdown editor called [Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr). It’s Open Source, so if you’re interested, [here you go](https://www.zettlr.com)!

Have you wondered about the logo to the left? It's Japanese and means _civil war_! Japanese is a good language to illustrate the problem of riots, because riots — at least as of now — are a very vague and opaque phenomenon. We do not really know what they are, and this is a strength of Japanese: Its symbols explain concepts rather than specific words. So while in English we have _civil war_, the Japanese symbols you see in the logo literally translate to the _concepts_ of "home" (the first symbol, 内) and "war" (the second symbol, 戦). The first line contains [the _Kanji_ for it](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%86%85%E6%88%A6), the second line the _Hiragana_ (that is: how it is spelled). It's pronounced ***naisen***.
