# About the Project

こんにちは！

Cool that you've found this page this early. Please be patient, I'll be adding more content later on!

Have you wondered about the logo to the left? It's Japanese and means _civil war_! Japanese is a good language to illustrate the problem of riots, because riots — at least as of now — are a very vague and opaque phenomenon. We do not really know what they are, and this is a strength of Japanese: Its symbols explain concepts rather than specific words. So while in English we have _civil war_, the Japanese symbols you see in the logo literally translate to the _concepts_ of "home" (the first symbol) and "war" (the second symbol). The first line contains [the _Kanji_ for it](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%86%85%E6%88%A6), the second line the _Hiragana_ (that is: how it is spelled). It's pronounced ***naisen***.
