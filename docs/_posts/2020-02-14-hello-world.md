# Hello, World

Beginnings are something fascinating. When do they start, and where do they end? My PhD is starting in these early weeks of 2020, but in fact the beginning was two and a half years ago. When I finished my master’s thesis in September 2017, I already knew I would go on to write a whole book on the core concept of my thesis. So I sat down, with nothing but a loose concept and determination. I wrote one word on an empty page and stared at it for days: _Stasis_. I knew what it means, but what I needed was a practical example with which I could clarify the concept and work on it. In my thesis, I used it to explain the “War on Terror,” but I wanted something new for a change. Then, a new project was announced and applications were open until January 2018. Its focus was protest. Here I had my idea: Why not use riots to elaborate on _stasis_?

So the idea was born. Within a month I finished a first proposal attached to my application; seven pages, all inclusive. And then it got rejected. In academia, this is pretty common, so nevermind. Work on the proposal! And so it grew, and grew, and grew. For over two years all I did was improve on the proposal, until I reached about ten pages, stuffed with information and data. The amount of references grew steadily, and with each iteration, the focus and the idea became more clear. While in the beginning of 2018 it read as “I think I probably know what _stasis_ is and I want to analyse some riots with it, but I don’t know which I want” it now reads completely different. There are four precise research questions, I have chosen four riots and can justify why I made this choice. I have added more explanations to the lesser known concepts my PhD project makes use of, such as “divine violence” or the differentiation between _polis_ and _oikos_.

The last iteration of my dissertation proposal then was initiated in late 2019. In November, I met my prospective supervisor, sent her my proposal, and with a few remarks, she gave it a go! This last iteration only took about six weeks, but the improvements were significant. The whole proposal is now 21 pages long, including 6 pages of literature. In the proposal alone, I made it to 100 footnotes. It now contains specific chapters on the international aspects of riots, the research questions, I clarified the methodology, and added a lot of important information to understand what it is about.

Soon I’ll be presenting the proposal in front of a group of researchers, and then, if everything goes according to plan, beginning with October 2020, the three “official” years of my PhD will begin.
